            DIY STEM Club (DIY Club) is a club built on the idea that people learn best when they are interested in the material. Members will learn programming and other technological skills while working towards one end project. These projects are suggested by the members, so that everyone is always interested. The skill might be taught by the organizers or be learned online, but the purpose of the project is to learn a practical application of computer skills
