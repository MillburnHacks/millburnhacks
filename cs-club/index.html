              We will use <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>
              to learn how to use... neural networks and deep learning. It's a very long, mathematical book and will take
              a few months to go through, but it provides a lot of information. Proper artificial intelligence requires
              mathematics, so don't try to find another text that hides the math.
              
              We will go through each chapter of the book at the meetings, but you should also read it by yourself prior
              to the meetings so that you can ask any questions you have.

              A simple AI that finds regressions for a data set was written and is available on
              <a href="https://gist.github.com/AbhinavMadahar/529de23fdce9a3c164b18794d740621c">GitHub</a>.
              It demonstrates gradient descent in a simple use-case.
