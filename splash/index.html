          </header>
          <p>
						Millburn Splash is a program where children in elementary and middle
						school can come to learn and have fun! All classes are taught by high school
						students with a wide array of interests, so there's always something for
						everyone!
					</p>
          <p>
						There are 4 hours, and 5 classes are taught each hour. You can decide which one to
            take when you come, but feel free to take a look at the current class list!
					</p>
					<header class="major">
            <h2>How do I come?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
						Before you come, please make sure to register. Tickets cost $20 per child and
						you pay at the door. All money raised goes to fund Millburn High School clubs.
						Each child must have a separate ticket. Up to one parent per family may come
						free of charge.
