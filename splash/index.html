              <p>
								Millburn Splash is a program where children in elementary and middle
								school can come to learn and have fun! All classes are taught by high school
								students with a wide array of interests, so there's always something for
								everyone!
							</p>
              <p>
								There are 4 hours, and 5 classes are taught each hour. You can decide which one to
                take when you come, but feel free to take a look at the current class list!
							</p>
							<header class="major">
                <h2>How do I come?</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
								Before you come, please make sure to register. Tickets cost $20 per child and
								you pay at the door. All money raised goes to fund Millburn High School clubs.
								Each child must have a separate ticket. Up to one parent per family may come
								free of charge.
