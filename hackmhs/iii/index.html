            <h2>What is hackMHS?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
						hackMHS is Millburn High School's hackathon. The first hackMHS was in October of 2015,
            and the second was in May of 2016. A hackathon is a programming competition in which
            prizes are given, but there are also lots of fun side-activities! Everything is free,
            including food, shirts, and more.

						All high school students are invited! You don't have to have programming experience
