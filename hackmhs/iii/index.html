          <p>
						hackMHS is Millburn High School's hackathon. The first hackMHS was in October of 2015,
            and the second was in May of 2016. A hackathon is a programming competition in which
            prizes are given, but there are also lots of fun side-activities! Everything is free,
            including food, shirts, and more.
					</p>

          <header class="major">
            <h2>Who can come?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
						All high school students are invited! You don't have to have programming experience
						or have gone to a hackathon before. If you're in college or older, we would love it
						if you could register as a mentor.
