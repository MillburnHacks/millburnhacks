                  <p>
										Millburn Splash is a 4-hour program where children in elementary and middle
										school can come to learn and have fun! All classes are taught by high school
										students with a wide array of interests, so there's always something for
										everyone!

                  <p>
										Before you come, please make sure to register. Tickets cost $20 per child and
										you pay at the door. All money raised goes to fund Millburn High School clubs.
										Each child must have a separate ticket. Up to one parent per family may come
										free of charge.
